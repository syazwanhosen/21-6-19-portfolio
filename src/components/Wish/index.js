          Alhamdulillah, after all obstacles we are facing in a group, we manage
          to finish all the tasks in time. Big thanks to Sir Muhammad 'Izzul
          'Ammar Bin Abd Latif that thought and guide us in Usrah 2. Secondly, I
          would like to thanks all the group members, that give commitment to
          finish the task given. I feel really satisfying by completing the Role
          Play and I hope it will be rewarded by Allah SWT and I learned
          something from Usrah 2. Thanks and Assalammualaikum ðŸ˜Š
